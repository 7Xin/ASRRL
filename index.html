        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Speaker Adaptation, which involves cloning voices from unseen speakers, has garnered significant interest due to its numerous applications in fields such as film, television, and radio. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle with inadequate speaker representation accuracy and overfitting, particularly in data-limited scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an Agile Speaker Representation Reinforcement Learning (ASRRL) strategy to enhance speaker similarity in speaker adaptation tasks. ASRRL is the first method to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the modeling accuracy of speaker embeddings in speaker adaptation, addressing the challenge of decoupling voice content and timbre. Our approach introduces two action strategies tailored to different reference speech scenarios. In the single-sentence (SS) scenario, we employ a knowledge-oriented optimal routine searching RL method to expedite the exploration and retrieval of refinement information on the fringe of speaker representations. In the few-sentence (FS) scenario, we utilize a dynamic fusion RL method to adaptively fuse a few reference speeches, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of speaker modeling. To achieve optimal results in the target domain, we propose a multi-scale fusion scoring mechanism that evaluates similarity, quality, and intelligibility across three dimensions. This comprehensive reward model ensures that improvements in speaker similarity do not come at the expense of speech quality or intelligibility. Our experimental results on the LibriTTS and VCTK datasets within mainstream VITS and diffusion TTS frameworks demonstrate the extensibility and generalization capabilities of ASRRL-TTS. The results indicate that ASRRL-TTS significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches, achieving higher speaker similarity and better overall speech quality with limited reference data.
